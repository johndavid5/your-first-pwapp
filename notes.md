**Note:** To simplify this codelab, and explain the fundamentals of
providing an offline experience, we're using vanilla JavaScript.
In a production app, we strongly recommend using tools like
[Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/)
to build your service worker. It removes many of the sharp edges and
dark corners you may run into.

**Remember:** Service worker functionality is only available on pages
that are accessed via HTTPS. (http://localhost and equivalents also
work to facilitate testing.)
